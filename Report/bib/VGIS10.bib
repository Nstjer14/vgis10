abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. This paper presents an online multiple object tracking (MOT) method based on tracking by detection. Tracking by detection has the inherent problems by false and miss detection. To deal with the false detection, we employed the Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filter because this filter is robust to noisy and random data processing containing many false observations. Thus, we revised the GM-PHD filter for visual MOT. Also, to handle miss detection, we propose a hierarchical tracking framework to associate fragmented or ID switched tracklets. Experiments with the representative dataset PETS 2009 S2L1 show that our framework are effective to decrease the errors by false and miss detection, and real-Time capability.},

@inproceedings{Seo2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.This paper proposes a new method for robust 3D object tracking from a single RGB image when an object model is available. The proposed method is based on image alignment between consecutive frames over a 3D target object. Different from conventional methods that only rely on image intensity for the alignment, we model intensity variations using the surface normal of the object. From this model, we also define a new constraint for the pose estimation, leading to significant improvement in the tracking robustness. In experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of our method by evaluating it under challenging tracking conditions.},

abstract = {In laboratory fish research, the zebrafish Danio rerio (Cyprinidae) represents the equivalent of the mouse in mammalian research. This species has become a major model for studies in developmental and behavioural genetics, neurophysiology, biomedicine, ecotoxicology, and behavioural and evolutionary ecology. To meet the need for accurate and reproducible data in both fundamental and applied sciences, it is of primary importance to be able to tag and/or recognize individual zebrafish. However, classic methods used in fish ecology and aquaculture are generally difficult to apply to such small fish. Recently, various new tagging methods have been developed. This paper presents a first review of current identification and marking methods applied to zebrafish, from external observation methods (such as skin pattern recognition, fin clipping, scale regeneration, colour and transgenic methods) to the most advanced technological developments in electronic (low- and high- radio-frequencies PIT tags, microchip) and image analysis methods (video tracking). This review aims to help researchers and zebrafish facility managers select the identification method (ID) best adapted to their needs. The main characteristics of each ID method are examined (including detection range, durability, speed and repetitiveness, ID code combination, size dependence and ethical considerations), and their pros and cons are summarized in a decision table to help select the most appropriate option for a research or management program. Finally, contextual applications of these ID methods and future developments are discussed.},

@article{HongWang2016,
abstract = {Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is one of the most widely used model organisms in collective behavior research. Multi-object tracking with high speed camera is currently the most feasible way to accurately measure their motion states for quantitative study of their collective behavior. However, due to difficulties such as their similar appearance, complex body deformation and frequent occlusions, it is a big challenge for an automated system to be able to reliably track the body geometry of each individual fish. To accomplish this task, we propose a novel fish body model that uses a chain of rectangles to represent fish body. Then in detection stage, the point of maximum curvature along fish boundary is detected and set as fish nose point. Afterwards, in tracking stage, we firstly apply Kalman filter to track fish head, then use rectangle chain fitting to fit fish body, which at the same time further judge the head tracking results and remove the incorrect ones. At last, a tracklets relinking stage further solves trajectory fragmentation due to occlusion. Experiment results show that the proposed tracking system can track a group of zebrafish with their body geometry accurately even when occlusion occurs from time to time.},

abstract = {Two border following algorithms are proposed for the topological analysis of digitized binary images. The first one determines the surroundness relations among the borders of a binary image. Since the outer borders and the hole borders have a one-to-one correspondence to the connected components of 1-pixels and to the holes, respectively, the proposed algorithm yields a representation of a binary image, from which one can extract some sort of features without reconstructing the image. The second algorithm, which is a modified version of the first, follows only the outermost borders (i.e., the outer borders which are not surrounded by holes). These algorithms can be effectively used in component counting, shrinking, and topological structural analysis of binary images, when a sequential digital computer is used. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {Zebrafish spend the majority of their time in groups, called shoals. Shoaling behavior is complex and dynamic: fish leave and rejoin the shoal, distances between shoal-members oscillate, and the speed and polarization of the shoal change on timescales of seconds to minutes. All these features of shoals can be modified by various pharmacological and environmental—and possibly also genetic—manipulations and a thorough characterization of shoaling behavior can therefore be used as an effective assay for complex aspects of vertebrate social behavior. We present methods for acquiring and analyzing detailed trajectory data from shoals of zebrafish and demonstrate how these methods can be used to distinguish episodes of shoaling under different conditions. These methods could be further developed to create a standardized assay of shoaling behavior that will allow for an in-depth exploration of social behaviors in zebrafish.},

This paper proposes a real-time multiple objects detection method and compares its performance with three existing methods. `Good Features to Track' algorithm is used to extract feature points from each frame. Based on the motion-based information, feature points corresponding to moving objects are extracted from next frame. Then, the number of moving objects in each frame is determined according to their motion-based information and position, and are later clustered using the k-means algorithm. Clustering of moving objects in this paper is performed using feature vectors made of pixels' intensities, motion magnitudes, motion directions and feature point positions. In terms of accuracy and efficiency, the proposed method is shown to be highly accurate in determining the number of moving objects and also fast in tracking them in the scene.},

abstract = {Due to its universality, swarm behavior in nature attracts much attention of scientists from many fields. Fish schools are examples of biological communities that demonstrate swarm behavior. The detection and tracking of fish in a school are of important significance for the quantitative research on swarm behavior. However, different from other biological communities, there are three problems in the detection and tracking of fish school, that is, variable appearances, complex motion and frequent occlusion. To solve these problems, we propose an effective method of fish detection and tracking. In this method, first, the fish head region is positioned through extremum detection and ellipse fitting; second, The Kalman filtering and feature matching are used to track the target in complex motion; finally, according to the feature information obtained by the detection and tracking, the tracking problems caused by frequent occlusion are processed through trajectory linking. We apply this method to track swimming fish school of different densities. The experimental results show that the proposed method is both accurate and reliable.},

abstract = {Animals in groups touch each other, move in paths that cross, and interact in complex ways. current video tracking methods sometimes switch identities of unmarked individuals during these interactions. these errors propagate and result in random assignments after a few minutes unless manually corrected. We present idtracker, a multitracking algorithm that extracts a characteristic fingerprint from each animal in a video recording of a group. it then uses these fingerprints to identify every individual throughout the video. tracking by identification prevents propagation of errors, and the correct identities can be maintained indefinitely. idtracker distinguishes animals even when humans cannot, such as for size-matched siblings, and reidentifies animals after they temporarily disappear from view or across different videos. it is robust, easy to use and general. We tested it on fish (Danio rerio and Oryzias latipes), flies (Drosophila melanogaster), ants (Messor structor) and mice (Mus musculus).},
