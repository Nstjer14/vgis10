abstract = {The use of mice as model organisms to study human biology is predicated on the genetic and physiological similarities between the species. Nonetheless, mice and humans have evolved in and become adapted to different environments and so, despite their phylogenetic relatedness, they have become very different organisms. Mice often respond to experimental interventions in ways that differ strikingly from humans. Mice are invaluable for studying biological processes that have been conserved during the evolution of the rodent and primate lineages and for investigating the developmental mechanisms by which the conserved mammalian genome gives rise to a variety of different species. Mice are less reliable as models of human disease, however, because the networks linking genes to disease are likely to differ between the two species. The use of mice in biomedical research needs to take account of the evolved differences as well as the similarities between mice and humans.},

abstract = {The use of aquatic animals for research purposes has been increasingly popular in recent years and this is especially true for the zebrafish (Danio rerio), which is being used for genetic, envi- ronmental and pharmaceutical studies, among others. The motion trajecto- ries of the fish can be an important metric and the studies are therefore often supported by a computer vision system, which automatically tracks the fish. However, the tracking is often only conducted on a single fish or in two dimensions, as most of this type of tracking software has been developed for mice, rats or similar. The focus of this thesis is hence to investigate the possibilities of tracking zebrafish in three dimensions. The proposed system is made of off-the-shelf hardware and consists of a stereo-vision setup with two GoPro HERO5 cameras. The zebrafish are detected in each camera using the SURF keypoint extractor after which the 3D positions are estimated. The 3D reconstruction is based on ray- tracing in combination with Snell's law, in order to account for refraction. By using a Kalman filter and Munkres algorithm it is possible to assemble tracklets with an average length of 150 frames. A final part of the system, responsible for linking the tracklets, has not been implemented in this iteration of the system.},

This paper proposes a real-time multiple objects detection method and compares its performance with three existing methods. `Good Features to Track' algorithm is used to extract feature points from each frame. Based on the motion-based information, feature points corresponding to moving objects are extracted from next frame. Then, the number of moving objects in each frame is determined according to their motion-based information and position, and are later clustered using the k-means algorithm. Clustering of moving objects in this paper is performed using feature vectors made of pixels' intensities, motion magnitudes, motion directions and feature point positions. In terms of accuracy and efficiency, the proposed method is shown to be highly accurate in determining the number of moving objects and also fast in tracking them in the scene.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York. Tracking individuals in a fish school with video cameras is one of the most effective ways to quantitatively investigate their behavior which is of great value for biological research. However, tracking large numbers of fish with complex non-rigid deformation, similar appearance and frequent mutual occlusions is a challenge task. In this paper we propose an effective tracking method that can reliably track a large number of fish throughout the entire duration. The first step of the proposed method is to detect fish heads using a scale-space method. Data association across frames is achieved via identifying the head image pattern of each individual fish in each frame, which is accomplished by a convolutional neural network (CNN) specially tailored to suit this task. Then the prediction of the motion state and the recognition result by CNN are combined to associate detections across frames. The proposed method was tested on 5 video clips having different number of fish respectively. Experiment results show that the correctness of their identities is not affected by frequent occlusions. The proposed method outperforms two state-of-the-art fish tracking methods in terms of 7 performance metrics.},

abstract = {This report describes the research conducted during the master thesis for the Vision, Graphics and Interactive Systems master programme. In this work, we explore a part of animal tracking: re-identification of zebrafish (Danio rerio), in particular. The literature demonstrates the impor- tance of the zebrafish for drug development and pushing the human understanding of organisms further. The state-of-the-art re-identification methods of zebrafish employ solely a top-view and grayscale images and require a lot of data for the best performance. This research rather aims to study how well the side-view and color images can perform in the same task while keeping data processing to a minimum. Inspired by the person re-identification field, two feature descriptors, each encoding both color and texture information, and five metric learning algorithms were tested. The contribution of the color and texture components of the feature descriptors were also investigated. Appendices: 19 Date of Completion: June 7th, 2018 The experiments were conducted on two and three fish, separately. The results show that for the same fish, a mean average precision (mAP) of 100{\%} can be obtained, and when testing on previously un- seen fish, a mAP of 89.40{\%} is achieved, at best. When training on small sequences, with a length up to only 50 frames, the methods can sustain very few (0-2{\%}) identity switches. This approach clearly shows potential and encourages the further research on the topic.},

abstract = {Object tracking and detection is a classical research area in the field of computer vision from decades. Numerous kinds of applications are dependent on the area of object detection, such as advance driving assistance system, traffic surveillance, scene understanding, autonomous navigation etc. Many challenges still exist while detecting an object such as illusion, low visibility, cast shadows and most importantly occlusions of object. Occlusions occur under two categories, firstly its, self‚Äêocclusion which means that, from a certain viewpoint, one part of an object is occluded by another part. Secondly, its inter-object occlusion which means when two objects being tracked occlude each other. We will review various occlusion handling methods that involved single and multiple cameras according to their application. In short, the objective of this paper is to deliberate in detail the problem of occlusion in object tracking and provide a concise review for the problem of occlusion handling under different categories and identify new trends.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. This paper presents an online multiple object tracking (MOT) method based on tracking by detection. Tracking by detection has the inherent problems by false and miss detection. To deal with the false detection, we employed the Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filter because this filter is robust to noisy and random data processing containing many false observations. Thus, we revised the GM-PHD filter for visual MOT. Also, to handle miss detection, we propose a hierarchical tracking framework to associate fragmented or ID switched tracklets. Experiments with the representative dataset PETS 2009 S2L1 show that our framework are effective to decrease the errors by false and miss detection, and real-Time capability.},

Shoaling behavior is complex and dynamic: fish leave and rejoin the shoal, distances between shoal-members oscillate, and the speed and polarization of the shoal change on timescales of seconds to minutes. All these features of shoals can be modified by various pharmacological and environmental‚Äîand possibly also genetic‚Äîmanipulations and a thorough characterization of shoaling behavior can therefore be used as an effective assay for complex aspects of vertebrate social behavior. We present methods for acquiring and analyzing detailed trajectory data from shoals of zebrafish and demonstrate how these methods can be used to distinguish episodes of shoaling under different conditions. These methods could be further developed to create a standardized assay of shoaling behavior that will allow for an in-depth exploration of social behaviors in zebrafish.},

abstract = {Automated movement tracking is essential for high-throughput quantitative analyses of the behaviour and kinematics of organisms. Automated tracking also improves replicability by avoiding observer biases and allowing reproducible workflows. However, few automated tracking programs exist that are open access, open source, and capable of tracking unmarked organisms in noisy environments. Tracktor is an image-based tracking freeware designed to perform single-object tracking in noisy environments, or multi-object tracking in uniform environments while maintaining individual identities. Tracktor is code-based but requires no coding skills other than the user being able to specify tracking parameters in a designated location, much like in a graphical user interface (GUI). The installation and use of the software is fully detailed in a user manual. Through four examples of common tracking problems, we show that Tracktor is able to track a variety of animals in diverse conditions. The main strengths of Tracktor lie in its ability to track single individuals under noisy conditions (e.g. when the object shape is distorted), its robustness to perturbations (e.g. changes in lighting conditions during the experiment), and its capacity to track multiple individuals while maintaining their identities. Additionally, summary statistics and plots allow measuring and visualizing common metrics used in the analysis of animal movement (e.g. cumulative distance, speed, acceleration, activity, time spent in specific areas, distance to neighbour, etc.). Tracktor is a versatile, reliable, easy-to-use automated tracking software that is compatible with all operating systems and provides many features not available in other existing freeware.

@article{Miller2012a,
abstract = {Animal groups on the move can take different configurations. For example, groups of fish can either be 'shoals' or 'schools': shoals are simply aggregations of individuals; schools are shoals exhibiting polarized, synchronized motion. Here we demonstrate that polarization distributions of groups of zebrafish (Danio rerio) are bimodal, showing two distinct modes of collective motion corresponding to the definitions of shoaling and schooling. Other features of the group's motion also vary consistently between the two modes: zebrafish schools are faster and less dense than zebrafish shoals. Habituation to an environment can also alter the proportion of time zebrafish groups spend schooling or shoaling. Models of collective motion suggest that the degree and stability of group polarization increases with the group's density. Examining zebrafish groups of different sizes from 5 to 50, we show that larger groups are less polarized than smaller groups. Decreased fearfulness in larger groups may function similarly to habituation, causing them to spend more time shoaling than schooling, contrary to most models' predictions.},

SURF approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster. This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (specifically, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper encompasses a detailed description of the detector and descriptor and then explores the effects of the most important parameters.

Multi-object tracking with high speed camera is currently the most feasible way to accurately measure their motion states for quantitative study of their collective behavior. However, due to difficulties such as their similar appearance, complex body deformation and frequent occlusions, it is a big challenge for an automated system to be able to reliably track the body geometry of each individual fish. To accomplish this task, we propose a novel fish body model that uses a chain of rectangles to represent fish body. Then in detection stage, the point of maximum curvature along fish boundary is detected and set as fish nose point. Afterwards, in tracking stage, we firstly apply Kalman filter to track fish head, then use rectangle chain fitting to fit fish body, which at the same time further judge the head tracking results and remove the incorrect ones. At last, a tracklets relinking stage further solves trajectory fragmentation due to occlusion. Experiment results show that the proposed tracking system can track a group of zebrafish with their body geometry accurately even when occlusion occurs from time to time.},

abstract = {Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly becoming an important model organism in neuroscience research, representing an excellent species to study complex social phenotypes. Zebrafish actively form shoals, which can be used to quantify their shoaling behaviors, highly sensitive to various experimental manipulations. Recent advances in video-tracking techniques have enabled simultaneous tracking of multiple subjects, previously assessed by manual scoring of animal behavior. Here we examined the effect of group-size in the shoaling paradigm (ranging from 2 to 8 fish), and evaluated the ability of novel video-tracking tools to accurately track an entire shoal, compared to traditional manual analysis of shoaling phenotypes. To further validate our approach, the effects of the psychotropic drugs lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and 3,4-methlenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), as well as exposure to alarm pheromone, previously shown to affect zebrafish shoaling, were examined. Overall, a significant difference in group size was shown in the 2-fish vs. the 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- and 8-fish groups. Moreover, both LSD and MDMA treatments reduced shoaling (assessed by increased inter-fish distance) as well as proximity (time spent together) among fish. In contrast, exposure to alarm pheromone yielded an increase in shoaling and in proximity in a time-dependent manner. Importantly, a highly significant correlation for manual vs. automated analyses was revealed across all experiments. Collectively, this study further supports the utility of zebrafish to study social behavior, also demonstrating the capacity of video-tracking technology to assess zebrafish shoaling in a high-throughput and reliable manner. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Dolado2014,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014, Psychonomic Society, Inc. Studying the collective behavior of fishes often requires tracking a great number of individuals. When many fishes move together, it is common for individuals to move so close to each other that some fishes superimpose themselves on others during one or several units of time, which impacts on tracking accuracy (i.e., loss of fish trajectories, interchange of fish identities). Type 1 occlusions arise when two fishes swim so near each other that they look like one long fish, whereas type 2 occlusions occur when the fishes' trajectories cross to create a T- or X-shaped individual. We propose an image processing method for resolving these types of occlusions when multitracking shoals in two dimensions. We assessed processing effectiveness after videorecording shoals of 20 and 40 individuals of two species that exhibit different shoal styles: zebrafish (Danio rerio) and black neon tetras (Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi). Results show that, although the number of occlusions depended on both the number of individuals and the species, the method is able to effectively resolve a great deal of occlusions, irrespective of the species and the number of individuals. It also produces images that can be used in a multitracking system to detect individual fish trajectories. Compared to other methods, our approach makes it possible to study shoals with water depths similar to those seen in the natural conditions of the two species studied.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet [1] and Fast R-CNN [2] have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features-using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model [3] , our detection system has a frame rate of 5 fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.},

@book{Levin2009,
abstract = {Models are used to represent complex problems in simplified forms‚Äîphysics, chemistry, and biology all make good use of models. The most familiar are the mathematical sorts that form the basis of natural science theory. In the life sciences, the concept of modeling can extend further to include experimental procedures and nonhuman subjects. For example, a neuroscientist might employ a rat running in a radial-arm maze to study working memory processes, or a mouse in an open-field test to study anxiety. The value of a model is primarily a function of its fidelity: in the case of a theoretical model, fidelity is measured in terms of predicted findings; in the case of biological models, the issue is couched in terms of validity. It is this second kind of model that concerns us in this chapter on neuroscience methods, where the challenge of model species is particularly acute because behavioral and brain processes are both extraordinarily complex, and the problem is to find species that display both interesting behavior and easily accessible neural processes. Rats and mice, unquestionably the most successful models in neuroscience, have been extremely effective in helping determine which mammalian brain regions and neurotransmitter systems involved in cognition, learning, and other varieties of behavioral function. But the invertebrate Aplysia, a marine mollusk, has also served as a molecular model of memory processes [1]. Such seemingly unrelated model species are useful to the extent that they balance external validity, simplicity, and cost. Most recently these considerations have led researchers in behavioral neuroscience to use fish, a sort of middle ground between rodents and mollusks. In this chapter we review progress in the behavioral neuroscience of the diminutive zebrafish (Danio rerio), a species that has already firmly established itself as a model of vertebrate development, and now opens new doors for the investigation of brain mechanisms. Zebrafish are sometimes identified as an alternative model (relative to classic rodent models), but the term complementary model might be more appropriate since it addresses the use of fish in addition to classic mammalian models. Some questions, such as about the role of frontal cortical and hippocampal structures in learning and memory, cannot be studied with fish since these are not evident (but see [2]). But other attributes of fish make them valuable models in behavioral neuroscience research. Developmental processes can be continuously visualized in species that have a clear chorion (egg sack). Reporter systems can highlight specific neural systems so that their proliferation, differentiation, migration, and projections can be easily discerned. Reversible genetic suppression through the morpholino technique can determine the importance of specific molecular mechanisms for neurodevelopment. Numerous mutants available also help with the evaluation of molecular mechanisms throughout life. Finally, fish are easily bred in great numbers and develop rapidly, reducing the cost of experimentation and significantly increasing research throughput‚Äîpotentially, more experiments can be run in less time to answer any number of questions. The merit of fish models is now a matter of record. Zebrafish, in particular, have been well used in genetics, neuroscience, pharmacology, and toxicology (e.g., see [3‚Äì7]). The next and ongoing step is to extend the zebrafish model to pursue questions of behavioral neuroscience, an undertaking that requires valid, reliable, and efficient methods of behavioral assessment.},

Fish schools are examples of biological communities that demonstrate swarm behavior. The detection and tracking of fish in a school are of important significance for the quantitative research on swarm behavior. However, different from other biological communities, there are three problems in the detection and tracking of fish school, that is, variable appearances, complex motion and frequent occlusion. To solve these problems, we propose an effective method of fish detection and tracking. In this method, first, the fish head region is positioned through extremum detection and ellipse fitting; second, The Kalman filtering and feature matching are used to track the target in complex motion; finally, according to the feature information obtained by the detection and tracking, the tracking problems caused by frequent occlusion are processed through trajectory linking. We apply this method to track swimming fish school of different densities. The experimental results show that the proposed method is both accurate and reliable.},

This species has become a major model for studies in developmental and behavioural genetics, neurophysiology, biomedicine, ecotoxicology, and behavioural and evolutionary ecology. To meet the need for accurate and reproducible data in both fundamental and applied sciences, it is of primary importance to be able to tag and/or recognize individual zebrafish. However, classic methods used in fish ecology and aquaculture are generally difficult to apply to such small fish. Recently, various new tagging methods have been developed. This paper presents a first review of current identification and marking methods applied to zebrafish, from external observation methods (such as skin pattern recognition, fin clipping, scale regeneration, colour and transgenic methods) to the most advanced technological developments in electronic (low- and high- radio-frequencies PIT tags, microchip) and image analysis methods (video tracking). This review aims to help researchers and zebrafish facility managers select the identification method (ID) best adapted to their needs. The main characteristics of each ID method are examined (including detection range, durability, speed and repetitiveness, ID code combination, size dependence and ethical considerations), and their pros and cons are summarized in a decision table to help select the most appropriate option for a research or management program. Finally, contextual applications of these ID methods and future developments are discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper, a semi-automatic multi-object tracking method to track a group of unmarked zebrafish is proposed. This method can handle partial occlusion cases, maintaining the correct identity of each individual. For every object, we extracted a set of geometric features to be used in the two main stages of the algorithm. The first stage selected the best candidate, based both on the blobs identified in the image and the estimate generated by a Kalman Filter instance. In the second stage, if the same candidate-blob is selected by two or more instances, a blob-partitioning algorithm takes place in order to split this blob and reestablish the instances' identities. If the algorithm cannot determine the identity of a blob, a manual intervention is required. This procedure was compared against a manual labeled ground truth on four video sequences with different numbers of fish and spatial resolution. The performance of the proposed method is then compared against two well-known zebrafish tracking methods found in the literature: one that treats occlusion scenarios and one that only track fish that are not in occlusion. Based on the data set used, the proposed method outperforms the first method in correctly separating fish in occlusion, increasing its efficiency by at least 8.15{\%} of the cases. As for the second, the proposed method's overall performance outperformed the second in some of the tested videos, especially those with lower image quality, because the second method requires high-spatial resolution images, which is not a requirement for the proposed method. Yet, the proposed method was able to separate fish involved in occlusion and correctly assign its identity in up to 87.85{\%} of the cases, without accounting for user intervention.},

Given the clear limitations of existing mammalian models, there is an urgent need for low-cost, high-throughput in-vivo technologies for drug and gene discovery. New method: Here, we introduce a new automated method for generating 3D (X,Y,Z) swim trajectories in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio), to improve their neurophenotyping. Results: Based on the Track3D module of EthoVision XT video tracking software (Noldus Information Technology), this tool enhances the efficient, high-throughput 3D analyses of zebrafish behavioral responses. Applied to adult zebrafish behavior, this 3D method is highly sensitive to various classes of psychotropic drugs, including selected psychostimulant and hallucinogenic agents. Comparison with existing Methods: Our present method offers a marked advance in the existing 2D and 3D methods of zebrafish behavioral phenotyping, minimizing research time and recording high-resolution, automatically synchronized videos with calculated, high-precision object positioning. Conclusions: Our novel approach brings practical simplicity and 'integrative' capacity to the often complex and error-prone quantification of zebrafish behavioral phenotypes. Illustrating the value of 3D swim path reconstructions for identifying experimentally-evoked phenotypic profiles, this method fosters innovative, ethologically relevant, and fully automated small molecule screens using adult zebrafish.},

Physiological similarity to mammals, ease of genetic manipulations, sensitivity to pharmacological and genetic factors, robust behavior, low cost, and potential for high-throughput screening contribute to the growing utility of zebrafish models in this field. Understanding zebrafish behavioral phenotypes provides important insights into neural pathways, physiological biomarkers, and genetic underpinnings of normal and pathological brain function. Novel zebrafish paradigms continue to appear with an encouraging pace, thus necessitating a consistent terminology and improved understanding of the behavioral repertoire. What can zebrafish 'do', and how does their altered brain function translate into behavioral actions? To help address these questions, we have developed a detailed catalog of zebrafish behaviors (Zebrafish Behavior Catalog, ZBC) that covers both larval and adult models. Representing a beginning of creating a more comprehensive ethogram of zebrafish behavior, this effort will improve interpretation of published findings, foster cross-species behavioral modeling, and encourage new groups to apply zebrafish neurobehavioral paradigms in their research. In addition, this glossary creates a framework for developing a zebrafish neurobehavioral ontology, ultimately to become part of a unified animal neurobehavioral ontology, which collectively will contribute to better integration of biological data within and across species.},

The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30{\%} relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012---achieving a mAP of 53.3{\%}. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also compare R-CNN to OverFeat, a recently proposed sliding-window detector based on a similar CNN architecture. We find that R-CNN outperforms OverFeat by a large margin on the 200-class ILSVRC2013 detection dataset.

abstract = {A feature point based method is proposed for tracking multiple fish in 3D space. First, a simplified representation of the object is realized through construction of two feature point models based on its appearance characteristics. After feature points are classified into occluded and non-occluded types, matching and association are performed, respectively. Finally, the object's motion trajectory in 3D space is obtained through integrating multi-view tracking results. Experimental results show that the proposed method can simultaneously track 3D motion trajectories for up to 10 fish accurately and robustly.},
annote = {States, that occlusions often occur more often in a side view than in a top view due to the shape of a fish.

The 3D view helps on solving the occlusions, but the detection of occlusions relies on skeletons endpoints or length.},

abstract = {Object class detection, also known as category-level object detection, has become one of the most focused areas in computer vision in the new century. This article attempts to provide a comprehensive survey of the recent technical achievements in this area of research. More than 270 major publications are included in this survey covering different aspects of the research, which include: (i) problem description: key tasks and challenges; (ii) core techniques: appearance modeling, localization strategies, and supervised classification methods; (iii) evaluation issues: approaches, metrics, standard datasets, and state-of-the-art results; and (iv) new development: particularly new approaches and applications motivated by the recent boom of social images. Finally, in retrospect of what has been achieved so far, the survey also discusses what the future may hold for object class detection research. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {Animals as model organisms, the silent sentinels, stand watch over the environ- mental health of the world. These are non-human animal species which can be used to understand specific biological processes and to obtain informations which can provide an insight into working of other organisms. Among the model organisms, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) is one of the best leading models to study developmental biology, cancer, toxicology, drug discovery, and molecular genetics. In addition, the zebrafish is increasingly used as a genetic model organism for aquaculture species and in toxicogenomics and also to generate zebrafish disease models for application in human biomedicines. This tiny fish is a versatile model organism for many fields of research because of its easy maintenance, breeding, and transparent body during early development.},

@article{idtracker2014,
abstract = {Animals in groups touch each other, move in paths that cross, and interact in complex ways. current video tracking methods sometimes switch identities of unmarked individuals during these interactions. these errors propagate and result in random assignments after a few minutes unless manually corrected. We present idtracker, a multitracking algorithm that extracts a characteristic fingerprint from each animal in a video recording of a group. it then uses these fingerprints to identify every individual throughout the video. tracking by identification prevents propagation of errors, and the correct identities can be maintained indefinitely. idtracker distinguishes animals even when humans cannot, such as for size-matched siblings, and reidentifies animals after they temporarily disappear from view or across different videos. it is robust, easy to use and general. We tested it on fish (Danio rerio and Oryzias latipes), flies (Drosophila melanogaster), ants (Messor structor) and mice (Mus musculus).},
