abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014, Psychonomic Society, Inc. Studying the collective behavior of fishes often requires tracking a great number of individuals. When many fishes move together, it is common for individuals to move so close to each other that some fishes superimpose themselves on others during one or several units of time, which impacts on tracking accuracy (i.e., loss of fish trajectories, interchange of fish identities). Type 1 occlusions arise when two fishes swim so near each other that they look like one long fish, whereas type 2 occlusions occur when the fishes' trajectories cross to create a T- or X-shaped individual. We propose an image processing method for resolving these types of occlusions when multitracking shoals in two dimensions. We assessed processing effectiveness after videorecording shoals of 20 and 40 individuals of two species that exhibit different shoal styles: zebrafish (Danio rerio) and black neon tetras (Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi). Results show that, although the number of occlusions depended on both the number of individuals and the species, the method is able to effectively resolve a great deal of occlusions, irrespective of the species and the number of individuals. It also produces images that can be used in a multitracking system to detect individual fish trajectories. Compared to other methods, our approach makes it possible to study shoals with water depths similar to those seen in the natural conditions of the two species studied.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors. Methods in Ecology and Evolution {\textcopyright} 2017 British Ecological Society Behavioural analysis based on video recording is becoming increasingly popular within research fields such as; ecology, medicine, ecotoxicology and toxicology. However, the programs available to analyse the data, which are free of cost, user-friendly, versatile, robust, fast and provide reliable statistics for different organisms (invertebrates, vertebrates and mammals) are significantly limited. We present an automated open-source executable software (ToxTrac) for image-based tracking that can simultaneously handle several organisms monitored in a laboratory environment. We compare the performance of ToxTrac with current accessible programs on the web. The main advantages of ToxTrac are as follows: (i) no specific knowledge of the geometry of the tracked bodies is needed; (ii) processing speed, ToxTrac can operate at a rate {\textgreater}25 frames per second in HD videos using modern computers; (iii) simultaneous tracking of multiple organisms in multiple arenas; (iv) integrated distortion correction and camera calibration; (v) robust against false positives; (vi) preservation of individual identification; (vii) useful statistics and heat maps in real scale are exported in image, text and excel formats. ToxTrac can be used for high speed tracking of insects, fish, rodents or other species, and provides useful locomotor information in animal behavior experiments.

abstract = {Object tracking and detection is a classical research area in the field of computer vision from decades. Numerous kinds of applications are dependent on the area of object detection, such as advance driving assistance system, traffic surveillance, scene understanding, autonomous navigation etc. Many challenges still exist while detecting an object such as illusion, low visibility, cast shadows and most importantly occlusions of object. Occlusions occur under two categories, firstly its, self‐occlusion which means that, from a certain viewpoint, one part of an object is occluded by another part. Secondly, its inter-object occlusion which means when two objects being tracked occlude each other. We will review various occlusion handling methods that involved single and multiple cameras according to their application. In short, the objective of this paper is to deliberate in detail the problem of occlusion in object tracking and provide a concise review for the problem of occlusion handling under different categories and identify new trends.},

abstract = {This article presents a novel scale- and rotation-invariant detector and descriptor, coined SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features). SURF approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster. This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (specifically, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper encompasses a detailed description of the detector and descriptor and then explores the effects of the most important parameters. We conclude the article with SURF's application to two challenging, yet converse goals: camera calibration as a special case of image registration, and object recognition. Our experiments underline SURF's usefulness in a broad range of topics in computer vision. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In laboratory fish research, the zebrafish Danio rerio (Cyprinidae) represents the equivalent of the mouse in mammalian research. This species has become a major model for studies in developmental and behavioural genetics, neurophysiology, biomedicine, ecotoxicology, and behavioural and evolutionary ecology. To meet the need for accurate and reproducible data in both fundamental and applied sciences, it is of primary importance to be able to tag and/or recognize individual zebrafish. However, classic methods used in fish ecology and aquaculture are generally difficult to apply to such small fish. Recently, various new tagging methods have been developed. This paper presents a first review of current identification and marking methods applied to zebrafish, from external observation methods (such as skin pattern recognition, fin clipping, scale regeneration, colour and transgenic methods) to the most advanced technological developments in electronic (low- and high- radio-frequencies PIT tags, microchip) and image analysis methods (video tracking). This review aims to help researchers and zebrafish facility managers select the identification method (ID) best adapted to their needs. The main characteristics of each ID method are examined (including detection range, durability, speed and repetitiveness, ID code combination, size dependence and ethical considerations), and their pros and cons are summarized in a decision table to help select the most appropriate option for a research or management program. Finally, contextual applications of these ID methods and future developments are discussed.},

abstract = {Background: Expanding the spectrum of organisms to model human brain phenotypes is critical for our improved understanding of the pathobiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Given the clear limitations of existing mammalian models, there is an urgent need for low-cost, high-throughput in-vivo technologies for drug and gene discovery. New method: Here, we introduce a new automated method for generating 3D (X,Y,Z) swim trajectories in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio), to improve their neurophenotyping. Results: Based on the Track3D module of EthoVision XT video tracking software (Noldus Information Technology), this tool enhances the efficient, high-throughput 3D analyses of zebrafish behavioral responses. Applied to adult zebrafish behavior, this 3D method is highly sensitive to various classes of psychotropic drugs, including selected psychostimulant and hallucinogenic agents. Comparison with existing Methods: Our present method offers a marked advance in the existing 2D and 3D methods of zebrafish behavioral phenotyping, minimizing research time and recording high-resolution, automatically synchronized videos with calculated, high-precision object positioning. Conclusions: Our novel approach brings practical simplicity and 'integrative' capacity to the often complex and error-prone quantification of zebrafish behavioral phenotypes. Illustrating the value of 3D swim path reconstructions for identifying experimentally-evoked phenotypic profiles, this method fosters innovative, ethologically relevant, and fully automated small molecule screens using adult zebrafish.},

abstract = {Due to its universality, swarm behavior in nature attracts much attention of scientists from many fields. Fish schools are examples of biological communities that demonstrate swarm behavior. The detection and tracking of fish in a school are of important significance for the quantitative research on swarm behavior. However, different from other biological communities, there are three problems in the detection and tracking of fish school, that is, variable appearances, complex motion and frequent occlusion. To solve these problems, we propose an effective method of fish detection and tracking. In this method, first, the fish head region is positioned through extremum detection and ellipse fitting; second, The Kalman filtering and feature matching are used to track the target in complex motion; finally, according to the feature information obtained by the detection and tracking, the tracking problems caused by frequent occlusion are processed through trajectory linking. We apply this method to track swimming fish school of different densities. The experimental results show that the proposed method is both accurate and reliable.},

abstract = {Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly gaining popularity in translational neuroscience and behavioral research. Physiological similarity to mammals, ease of genetic manipulations, sensitivity to pharmacological and genetic factors, robust behavior, low cost, and potential for high-throughput screening contribute to the growing utility of zebrafish models in this field. Understanding zebrafish behavioral phenotypes provides important insights into neural pathways, physiological biomarkers, and genetic underpinnings of normal and pathological brain function. Novel zebrafish paradigms continue to appear with an encouraging pace, thus necessitating a consistent terminology and improved understanding of the behavioral repertoire. What can zebrafish 'do', and how does their altered brain function translate into behavioral actions? To help address these questions, we have developed a detailed catalog of zebrafish behaviors (Zebrafish Behavior Catalog, ZBC) that covers both larval and adult models. Representing a beginning of creating a more comprehensive ethogram of zebrafish behavior, this effort will improve interpretation of published findings, foster cross-species behavioral modeling, and encourage new groups to apply zebrafish neurobehavioral paradigms in their research. In addition, this glossary creates a framework for developing a zebrafish neurobehavioral ontology, ultimately to become part of a unified animal neurobehavioral ontology, which collectively will contribute to better integration of biological data within and across species.},

abstract = {Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is one of the most widely used model organisms in collective behavior research. Multi-object tracking with high speed camera is currently the most feasible way to accurately measure their motion states for quantitative study of their collective behavior. However, due to difficulties such as their similar appearance, complex body deformation and frequent occlusions, it is a big challenge for an automated system to be able to reliably track the body geometry of each individual fish. To accomplish this task, we propose a novel fish body model that uses a chain of rectangles to represent fish body. Then in detection stage, the point of maximum curvature along fish boundary is detected and set as fish nose point. Afterwards, in tracking stage, we firstly apply Kalman filter to track fish head, then use rectangle chain fitting to fit fish body, which at the same time further judge the head tracking results and remove the incorrect ones. At last, a tracklets relinking stage further solves trajectory fragmentation due to occlusion. Experiment results show that the proposed tracking system can track a group of zebrafish with their body geometry accurately even when occlusion occurs from time to time.},

@book{Levin2009,
abstract = {Models are used to represent complex problems in simplified forms—physics, chemistry, and biology all make good use of models. The most familiar are the mathematical sorts that form the basis of natural science theory. In the life sciences, the concept of modeling can extend further to include experimental procedures and nonhuman subjects. For example, a neuroscientist might employ a rat running in a radial-arm maze to study working memory processes, or a mouse in an open-field test to study anxiety. The value of a model is primarily a function of its fidelity: in the case of a theoretical model, fidelity is measured in terms of predicted findings; in the case of biological models, the issue is couched in terms of validity. It is this second kind of model that concerns us in this chapter on neuroscience methods, where the challenge of model species is particularly acute because behavioral and brain processes are both extraordinarily complex, and the problem is to find species that display both interesting behavior and easily accessible neural processes. Rats and mice, unquestionably the most successful models in neuroscience, have been extremely effective in helping determine which mammalian brain regions and neurotransmitter systems involved in cognition, learning, and other varieties of behavioral function. But the invertebrate Aplysia, a marine mollusk, has also served as a molecular model of memory processes [1]. Such seemingly unrelated model species are useful to the extent that they balance external validity, simplicity, and cost. Most recently these considerations have led researchers in behavioral neuroscience to use fish, a sort of middle ground between rodents and mollusks. In this chapter we review progress in the behavioral neuroscience of the diminutive zebrafish (Danio rerio), a species that has already firmly established itself as a model of vertebrate development, and now opens new doors for the investigation of brain mechanisms. Zebrafish are sometimes identified as an alternative model (relative to classic rodent models), but the term complementary model might be more appropriate since it addresses the use of fish in addition to classic mammalian models. Some questions, such as about the role of frontal cortical and hippocampal structures in learning and memory, cannot be studied with fish since these are not evident (but see [2]). But other attributes of fish make them valuable models in behavioral neuroscience research. Developmental processes can be continuously visualized in species that have a clear chorion (egg sack). Reporter systems can highlight specific neural systems so that their proliferation, differentiation, migration, and projections can be easily discerned. Reversible genetic suppression through the morpholino technique can determine the importance of specific molecular mechanisms for neurodevelopment. Numerous mutants available also help with the evaluation of molecular mechanisms throughout life. Finally, fish are easily bred in great numbers and develop rapidly, reducing the cost of experimentation and significantly increasing research throughput—potentially, more experiments can be run in less time to answer any number of questions. The merit of fish models is now a matter of record. Zebrafish, in particular, have been well used in genetics, neuroscience, pharmacology, and toxicology (e.g., see [3–7]). The next and ongoing step is to extend the zebrafish model to pursue questions of behavioral neuroscience, an undertaking that requires valid, reliable, and efficient methods of behavioral assessment.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Video analysis of animal behaviour is widely used in fields such as ecology, ecotoxicology, and evolutionary research. However, when tracking multiple animals, occlusion and crossing are problematic, especially when the identity of each individual needs to be preserved. We present a new algorithm, ToxId, which preserves the identity of multiple animals by linking trajectory segments using their intensity histogram and Hu-moments. We verify the performance and accuracy of our algorithm using video sequences with different animals and experimental conditions. The results show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art accuracy using an efficient approach without the need of learning processes, complex feature maps or knowledge of the animal shape. ToxId is also computationally efficient, has low memory requirements, and operates without accessing future or past frames.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York. Tracking individuals in a fish school with video cameras is one of the most effective ways to quantitatively investigate their behavior which is of great value for biological research. However, tracking large numbers of fish with complex non-rigid deformation, similar appearance and frequent mutual occlusions is a challenge task. In this paper we propose an effective tracking method that can reliably track a large number of fish throughout the entire duration. The first step of the proposed method is to detect fish heads using a scale-space method. Data association across frames is achieved via identifying the head image pattern of each individual fish in each frame, which is accomplished by a convolutional neural network (CNN) specially tailored to suit this task. Then the prediction of the motion state and the recognition result by CNN are combined to associate detections across frames. The proposed method was tested on 5 video clips having different number of fish respectively. Experiment results show that the correctness of their identities is not affected by frequent occlusions. The proposed method outperforms two state-of-the-art fish tracking methods in terms of 7 performance metrics.},

abstract = {Multiple objects detection and tracking are amongst the most important tasks in computer vision-based surveillance and activity recognition. This paper proposes a real-time multiple objects detection method and compares its performance with three existing methods. `Good Features to Track' algorithm is used to extract feature points from each frame. Based on the motion-based information, feature points corresponding to moving objects are extracted from next frame. Then, the number of moving objects in each frame is determined according to their motion-based information and position, and are later clustered using the k-means algorithm. Clustering of moving objects in this paper is performed using feature vectors made of pixels' intensities, motion magnitudes, motion directions and feature point positions. In terms of accuracy and efficiency, the proposed method is shown to be highly accurate in determining the number of moving objects and also fast in tracking them in the scene.},

abstract = {Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

abstract = {Zebrafish spend the majority of their time in groups, called shoals. Shoaling behavior is complex and dynamic: fish leave and rejoin the shoal, distances between shoal-members oscillate, and the speed and polarization of the shoal change on timescales of seconds to minutes. All these features of shoals can be modified by various pharmacological and environmental—and possibly also genetic—manipulations and a thorough characterization of shoaling behavior can therefore be used as an effective assay for complex aspects of vertebrate social behavior. We present methods for acquiring and analyzing detailed trajectory data from shoals of zebrafish and demonstrate how these methods can be used to distinguish episodes of shoaling under different conditions. These methods could be further developed to create a standardized assay of shoaling behavior that will allow for an in-depth exploration of social behaviors in zebrafish.},

@article{Sridhar2019,
abstract = {Automated movement tracking is essential for high-throughput quantitative analyses of the behaviour and kinematics of organisms. Automated tracking also improves replicability by avoiding observer biases and allowing reproducible workflows. However, few automated tracking programs exist that are open access, open source, and capable of tracking unmarked organisms in noisy environments. Tracktor is an image-based tracking freeware designed to perform single-object tracking in noisy environments, or multi-object tracking in uniform environments while maintaining individual identities. Tracktor is code-based but requires no coding skills other than the user being able to specify tracking parameters in a designated location, much like in a graphical user interface (GUI). The installation and use of the software is fully detailed in a user manual. Through four examples of common tracking problems, we show that Tracktor is able to track a variety of animals in diverse conditions. The main strengths of Tracktor lie in its ability to track single individuals under noisy conditions (e.g. when the object shape is distorted), its robustness to perturbations (e.g. changes in lighting conditions during the experiment), and its capacity to track multiple individuals while maintaining their identities. Additionally, summary statistics and plots allow measuring and visualizing common metrics used in the analysis of animal movement (e.g. cumulative distance, speed, acceleration, activity, time spent in specific areas, distance to neighbour, etc.). Tracktor is a versatile, reliable, easy-to-use automated tracking software that is compatible with all operating systems and provides many features not available in other existing freeware.

@article{Feijo2018,
abstract = {In this paper, a semi-automatic multi-object tracking method to track a group of unmarked zebrafish is proposed. This method can handle partial occlusion cases, maintaining the correct identity of each individual. For every object, we extracted a set of geometric features to be used in the two main stages of the algorithm. The first stage selected the best candidate, based both on the blobs identified in the image and the estimate generated by a Kalman Filter instance. In the second stage, if the same candidate-blob is selected by two or more instances, a blob-partitioning algorithm takes place in order to split this blob and reestablish the instances' identities. If the algorithm cannot determine the identity of a blob, a manual intervention is required. This procedure was compared against a manual labeled ground truth on four video sequences with different numbers of fish and spatial resolution. The performance of the proposed method is then compared against two well-known zebrafish tracking methods found in the literature: one that treats occlusion scenarios and one that only track fish that are not in occlusion. Based on the data set used, the proposed method outperforms the first method in correctly separating fish in occlusion, increasing its efficiency by at least 8.15{\%} of the cases. As for the second, the proposed method's overall performance outperformed the second in some of the tested videos, especially those with lower image quality, because the second method requires high-spatial resolution images, which is not a requirement for the proposed method. Yet, the proposed method was able to separate fish involved in occlusion and correctly assign its identity in up to 87.85{\%} of the cases, without accounting for user intervention.},

abstract = {Animals in groups touch each other, move in paths that cross, and interact in complex ways. current video tracking methods sometimes switch identities of unmarked individuals during these interactions. these errors propagate and result in random assignments after a few minutes unless manually corrected. We present idtracker, a multitracking algorithm that extracts a characteristic fingerprint from each animal in a video recording of a group. it then uses these fingerprints to identify every individual throughout the video. tracking by identification prevents propagation of errors, and the correct identities can be maintained indefinitely. idtracker distinguishes animals even when humans cannot, such as for size-matched siblings, and reidentifies animals after they temporarily disappear from view or across different videos. it is robust, easy to use and general. We tested it on fish (Danio rerio and Oryzias latipes), flies (Drosophila melanogaster), ants (Messor structor) and mice (Mus musculus).},
