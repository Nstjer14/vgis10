On basis of \autoref{cha:research} \nameref{cha:research} and \autoref{ch:analysis} \nameref{ch:analysis} a problem statement is presented to clarify the objective of this thesis.

\textbf{How can occlusion detection solutions be utilised to minimise the amount of total frames flagged for occlusion in a fish tracking system?}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Which solution detects the highest amount of occlusions?
	\item Which solution has the highest precision?
	\item
