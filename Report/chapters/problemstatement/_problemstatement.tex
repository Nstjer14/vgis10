\chapter{Problem Statement}
On the basis of \autoref{ch:research} \nameref{ch:research} and \autoref{ch:analysis} \nameref{ch:analysis} a problem statement is presented to clarify the objective of this thesis.\\

\textbf{How can occlusion detection solutions be utilised to minimise the amount of total frames flagged for occlusion in a fish tracking system?}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How can occlusions be detected?
	\item Which solutions detects the highest amount of occlusions?
\end{itemize}
