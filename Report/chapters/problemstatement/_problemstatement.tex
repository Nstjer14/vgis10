\chapter{Problem Statement}
Based on \autoref{ch:intro}, a problem statement is made:

\textbf{\textit{How can a zebrafish occlusion detection solution be implemented in order to potentially optimise zebrafish tracking?}}\\

As stated in \autoref{sec:int_dep} the kind of detection necessary is dependent on the system. Therefore some specifications of the problem statement are defined with the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item How can occlusions be detected in a sequence of images of zebrafish? %How do we detect an occlusion in an image?
	\item Dependent on user interaction level what kind of detection is required?
	\item How can zebrafish occlusions be categorised if necessary?
	%\item Which types of occlusions are the most frequently occurring?
	%\item What occlusion solving techniques can be applied to zebrafish occlusions? 
	%\item What occlusion solving techniques can be applied to each occlusion type?
\end{itemize}
