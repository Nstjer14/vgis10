To be able to further develop on the tracking system presented in the \nameref{ch:intro}, background research and system analysis is necessary. In this chapter, the existing Loligo Systems solution LoliTrack is presented as well as the company it self, together with the an overview of tasks to solved for 3D tracking implementation. A further state of the art solutions is presented in \autoref{ch:related_work}.
